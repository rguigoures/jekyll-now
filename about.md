This blog aims at showing some of my data analysis and tutorials. I am currently senior data scientist at Zalando in Berlin, mainly working on garments size recommendation. I have interest in general machine learning, information theory, Bayesian theory, deep learning, and exploratory data analysis.

Besides that, I also like Berlin, techno, playing squash, cooking, traveling, and many other things.
